# Basic DataStructure
This repo is created to store my practice code. Here I implemented some common data structures and algorithms using **Java**.
Anyway, I hope you can have fun. GL.

Besides, I highly recommend this course for you! It's really amazing!  **[CS61b_sp23](https://sp23.datastructur.es/)**
